    <h1>Get to Know Me</h1>
    <p>In high school I used to create multiple blogs on tumblr, and I'd spend hours scrolling the #theme hashtag to
        find the perfect theme. I'd then spend the next few hours going through the theme code to tweak it exactly to my
        liking. I did this for a few years, loving the immediate changes I'd see by my edits to the code.</p>
    <p>Since then, I'd constantly question what I wanted my career path to be, and I'd remember how much I loved editing
        the code. I'd do beginner tutorials every couple years or so, confirming that yes, I was still interested in
        that. However, it wasn't until Spring 2022 when I decided that I was definitely going to work toward being a web
        developer. I got a new job in a new state a month later, and that demanded the majority of my time and energy.
        In the Fall of 2023, however, I decided that I had to dedicate myself to learning to code for real this time.
    </p>
    <p>Time will pass either way, so I might as well spend the time pursuing my passion. At the time of writing this,
        I'm completing the HTML modules and I'll be moving onto CSS soon!</p>
